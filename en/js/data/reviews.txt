Jovan Vučetić|The guy is kind, efficient, reliable, all recommendations!
Andrej|Excellent service. Took laptop for thermal paste replacement and cleaning. Completed in less than a day.
Marina Bogic|Cooperation with Megika is excellent. I took an old desktop computer on which the system could not boot and it was solved in the shortest possible time. The computer was repaired in a very short time and at a very favorable price. At the same time, great gentlemen who did not allow me to take the computer to the car alone. :) All recommendations for Megik computer service
Nikola Radivojević|The laptop was repaired in record time (one day), now it works like the day I bought it. All praise for the guy, professional, polite and maximally professional. He was even willing to explain to me, a layman, what exactly was the reason for the failure and gave a written guarantee for his work.
